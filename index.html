        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Swami Vivekananda (1867–1947), a prominent Hindu philosopher, political activist, and spiritual leader, was
            born in Bombay, India. Born into a family of agricultural laborers, he developed a love for learning and
            became interested in philosophy. His early education at the Gokhande School in Bombay was marked by academic
            excellence and intellectual rigor. After obtaining his PhD in logic from the University of Cambridge, he
            returned to India and became a professor at the Indian National Institute of Science and Technology (IISc).

        <h2>Early Life and Spiritual Journey </h2>
        <p>Vivekananda was born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family and showed an early inclination towards
            spirituality. At the age of 18, he met the mystic Ramakrishna, becoming his chief disciple. After
            Ramakrishna's death in 1886, Vivekananda traveled across India as a wandering monk, gaining insight into the
            dire conditions faced by many Indians under British rule. His experiences deeply influenced his later
            teachings and social activism12.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Vivekananda's journey began with a visit to the Himalayas in 1895. He spent four months there, learning about
            the harsh realities faced by the Hindus under British rule. He was deeply moved by the suffering and poverty
            experienced by the Hindus and by the spiritual significance of the Himalayas. His experiences inspired him
            to advocate for the rights and dignity of Hindus, as well as for the protection of India's natural
            resources. He also became a prominent member of the Bengali community, becoming a part of the Bengali
            community's spiritual and intellectual life.</p>

His opening address, which began with "Sisters and brothers of America," captivated the audience and established him as a key figure in promoting interfaith dialogue. He emphasized the unity of all religions and advocated for
        tolerance and understanding among different faiths13.
